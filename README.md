Program to track my hamster how far my hamster runs on his wheel at night.<br>
I had a little magnet on the back of his wheel and a magnet detector behind it on<br>
the back of the cage which would detect when the magnet went by.<br>
From there I could calculate the distance and store and graph it.<br>
